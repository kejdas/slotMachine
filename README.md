# slotMachine
This code defines a simple slot machine game that generates a random combination of symbols and allows the user to bet on a certain number of lines. If the user's chosen lines contain the same symbol, the user wins an amount of money equal to the symbol's value multiplied by the bet amount. The game continues until the user runs out of money or decides to quit.
